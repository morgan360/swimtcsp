# BOIP

Hosted Payment Page Integration is designed for technologically enabled merchants who manage systems that provide and manage the full customer shopping experience, but do not have PCI Compliant environments to process payment cards and other cardholder sensitive data. The primary feature of this integration method with the Gateway is that the merchant incorporates the Gateway’s Hosted Payment Page into the website’s checkout page.

The Hosted Payment Page will provide for card payments and alternate payment methods.

Merchants may have:

* eCommerce websites or apps where their customers shop and pay for goods and services online – ECOM transactions
* and/or Customer Order Management system where merchant operators take orders over the phone or from other remote communications methods – MOTO transactions

The merchant’s applications use the Gateway to process payment authorisations and the supporting functionality (captures, voids, refunds, etc.) and 3DS authentications.

An additional feature of this integration method is a Hybrid Integration, where Hosted Payment Page Integrated merchants will also use the Direct API integration in other scenarios (e.g. for repeat transactions (recurring) using a stored card token generated using the Hosted Payment Page).

There are 3 integration modes available for the Hosted Payment Page:

**1. HostedPayPage** (a standard payment page with static **BOIPA/EVO** branding), fully redirected from the merchant site;

**2. Standalone** iFrame (a customisable payment page where fonts/colours may be changed), fully redirected from the merchant site;

**3. Embedded** iFrame (a customisable payment page where fonts/colours may be changed), embedded in a container within the merchant site;
